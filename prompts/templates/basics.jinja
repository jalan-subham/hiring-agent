      }
    ]
  }
}

**IMPORTANT**: If there is any About Me or Summary section, add that to the summary section of the basics

**CRITICAL**: For profiles section:
- ONLY extract URLs that are EXPLICITLY present in the resume markdown
- Look for URLs in markdown format [text](url) or plain URLs
- DO NOT create any URLs that are not in the original resume
- DO NOT add generic platform URLs like "https://github.com" or "https://linkedin.com" unless they are actually present in the resume
- If no URLs are found in the resume, return an empty profiles array: "profiles": []
- If a URL is present but you cannot determine the network or username, still include it with the available information
- If the URL is of the format github.io or personal domain, mark the network as "Portfolio"
- If there is any link at the header of the resume or Portfolio link, add that as url in the basics
